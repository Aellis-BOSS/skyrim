Masterlist Syntax Notes

Unlike the other masterlists, this one should take full advantage of MF2.2 syntax. Only the most commonly-used parts of the syntax are covered here.
See the BOSS Masterlist Syntax.html documentation file in data/boss-common/ on the Google Code repository for full details.

  * Use blank lines to separate mods that are grouped together or where it helps readability.
  * Use silent comments when you think something needs clarification to others reading the masterlist (such as when a mod looks like it is misspelled, but is correct).
  * Only make edits/additions you're confident about - otherwise discuss the issue on the official forum threads.
  * If you're unsure on how to write something in the correct syntax, check the masterlists for examples, and don't be afraid to ask other committers for help.
  * When you include a web link in a message, enclose it in double quotes "", for example: www.example.org should be written "www.example.org".
  * When you list Bash Tags for a mod, separate them using ", " and not just ",". Eg. {{BASH: Graphics,NoMerge}} should be written {{BASH: Graphics, NoMerge}}. This improves readability in the BOSSlog and the masterlist itself.
  * Don't include any HTML formatting in messages. In particular, web links do not need to be formatted as HTML hyperlinks, as BOSS will do this automatically.

Silent Comments:

Silent comments are ignored by BOSS, and may be written by starting a line with the backslash '\' character (as used by this block of text).
You cannot start a silent comment part-way into a line, only whole lines may be silent.
