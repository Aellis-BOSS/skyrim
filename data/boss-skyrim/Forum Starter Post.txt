BOSS will re-order your mods to their correct positions, putting any mods it doesn't recognise after them, in the same order as they were before BOSS was run.

BOSS is designed to assist in the usage of mods, helping mod users avoid serious conflicts. It is not a complete solution to load ordering issues, as there are far more mods out there than BOSS knows about. To properly place mods BOSS doesn't know about, a good working knowledge of mod load ordering for Skyrim is still necessary, for which some research and documentation reading will go a long way.

[size="5"]Contributions & Help[/size]

General discussion, and the submission of questions, suggestions and unrecognised or unclean mods, takes place in BOSS's official threads for [url=http://forums.bethsoft.com/?showtopic=1375486]Oblivion[/url], [url=http://forums.bethsoft.com/?showtopic=1132338]Nehrim[/url], [url=http://forums.bethsoft.com/?showtopic=1383848]Skyrim[/url], [url=http://forums.bethsoft.com/?showtopic=1282711]Fallout 3[/url] and [url=http://forums.bethsoft.com/?showtopic=1313081]Fallout: New Vegas[/url].

User contribution of additions and corrections to the masterlist are vital to the upkeep of BOSS. Let us know what you know.

Lists of unrecognized mods are welcome but the only way we can include them in the database in a timely way is if we get:

[list]
[*] The ESP/ESM file name(s).
[*] A link to the description, and where the plugin can be downloaded.
[*] A brief description of each mod is appreciated.  Feel free to make load order suggestions.
[*] If available any links to readme file(s) that can be read or downloaded.
[*] New users unable to post links follow the above directions, but in place of a link state the site (Nexus, Steam Workshop, Other), and the plugin ID. (id=17605)
[*] NOTE: Steam Workshop links and IDs are only visible when viewing the Steam Workshop with a web browser.
[/list]
Lists of unclean mods are also very welcome, but for the report to be most useful we require:

[list]
[*] The ESP/ESM file name(s).
[*] The number of records removed (the ITM count) as shown by TES5Edit (not the number of records processed).
[*] The number of records undeleted (the UDR count) as shown by TES5Edit (not the number of records processed).
[*] The CRC(s) of the unlcean ESP/ESM file name(s). Make sure that the CRCs are of the uncleaned files, not the files after cleaning. The CRC(s) may be calculated using BOSS, Wrye Bash or 7-zip, with other sources being unverified as correct. In the case of 7-zip, the "CRC checksum for data" is the one required.

[size="5"]License[/size]

BOSS is distributed under the [url=http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html]GNU General Public License v3.0[/url], aside from the documentation, which is distributed under the [url=http://www.gnu.org/licenses/fdl.html]GNU Free Documentation License v1.3[/url]. The documents covered by the latter license are "BOSS ReadMe.html", "BOSS User Rules ReadMe.html", "BOSS API ReadMe.html" and "BOSS Masterlist Syntax.html".

For the full text of both licenses, see the included "Licenses.txt" file.

While the GPL license allows anyone to make derivative works of BOSS, the BOSS Development Team encourages those thinking of doing so to first discuss their reasoning for such an endevour with the Team. It may be that what the derivative work would do differently from BOSS itself is already planned for a future version of BOSS or would be happily integrated into BOSS by the Team, thus avoiding any extra effort by others.

The BOSS Team also appeals to the community to avoid the distribution and development of alternative masterlists, as this would only hamper the community effort to create one universally-optimised load order for all plugins available for download. Any issues with a masterlist are best brought to the attention of the BOSS Team so that we may remedy them ourselves.
